## Getting Started

**To get a local copy up and running follow these steps:**

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


### Prerequisites
You need an IDE of your choice (preferably Visual Studio Code).
You will need a browser (preferably Chrome) to view the webpage.
You need to have installed npm and JSON-server on your local machine. 

### Setup
Clone the project using these links depending on your local environment using https or ssh

### Install
- After a successful clone, move into the project directory and run ``npm install`` to install the required node modules
- Next, run ``json-server --watch db.json`` to boot the server/backend
- Then run ``npm start`` to start the react app.

- If you haven't installed json-server, use ``npm -i -g json-server`` to install the server on a global scope
- Open terminal and navigate into the project root folder, run ``ls`` to check if a file ```db.json``` is present then run ``json-server --watch db.json`` to start the server.

### Usage
- Make sure your json-server is running for the app to work as intended.
- The project requires an internet connection to work because information is fetched from an external source.
