## Getting Started

**To get a local copy up and running follow these steps:**

### Prerequisites
You need an IDE of your choice (preferably Visual Studio Code).
You will need a browser (preferably Chrome) to view the webpage.
You need to have installed npm and JSON-server on your local machine. 

### Setup
Clone the project using these links depending on your local environment:
- [https](https://github.com/david-commit/FAQ-page.git) or [ssh](git@github.com:david-commit/FAQ-page.git)

### Install
- On the root folder, locate the ``index.html`` and open with your IDE
- Run LiveServer to open the page on your default browser.

- If you haven't installed json-server, use ``npm -i -g json-server`` to install the server on a global scope
- Open terminal and navigate into the assets folder, run ``ls`` to check if a file ```db.json``` is present then run ``json-server --watch db.json`` to start the server.

### Usage
- Make sure your json-server is running for the app to work as intended.
- The project does not need an internet connection to work because information is fetched from your local server.

### Run tests
- If json-server is not running, dummy Questions and Answers will be displayed.

### Deployment

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
